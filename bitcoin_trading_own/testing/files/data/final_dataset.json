It's no secret that the both of us Are running out of time So hello from the other side (Other side) I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside (Outside) At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried) To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Anymore Hello from the other side (Other side) I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside (Outside) At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried) To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  "

The cops came by to bring Earl in They searched the house high and low Then they tipped their hats And said \"Thank you ladies, if you hear from him let us know,\" Well, the weeks went by and Spring turned to summer And summer faded into fall And it turns out he was a missing person Who nobody missed at all So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand Out on Highway 109They sell Tennessee ham And strawberry jam And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause  Earl had to die Goodbye Earl We need a break Let's go out to the lake, Earl We'll pack a lunch And stuff you in the trunk, Earl Well, is that all right?Good, let's go for a ride Earl Hey Well hey, hey, hey Aw, hey, hey, hey Well hey, hey, hey"

Close enough Shout out to what is done R.I.P., here comes the sun(Comes the sun)  Gone a little far Gone a little far this time with something Rudi said it's fine They used to do this all the time in college (If you and I get comfortable) And we're on the borderline (Ooh) Caught between the tides of pain and rapture Then I saw the time Watched it speedin' by like a train Will I be known and loved?Is there one that I trust?Starting to sober up Has it been long enough?Will I be known and loved?Little closer, close enough I'm a loser, loosen up Setting free, must be tough Will I be known and loved?Is there one that I trust?Starting to sober up Has it been long enough?Will I be so in love?Any closer?

Except roll down the window And let the wind blow back your hair Well the night's busting open These two lanes will take us anywhere We got one last chance to make it real To trade in these wings on some wheels Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks Oh-oh come take my hand We're riding out tonight to case the promised land Oh-oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road Lying out there like a killer in the sun Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run Oh, Thunder Road, sit tight, take hold Thunder Road Well I got this guitar, and I learned how to make it talk And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk From your front porch to my front seat The door's open but the ride it ain't free And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken  There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away They haunt this dusty beach road In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets They scream your name at night in the street Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet And in the lonely cool before dawn You hear their engines roaring on But when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind So Mary, climb in It's a town full of losers and I'm pulling out of here to win"

A heartless bastard, high and plastered My style is like the reaction from too much acid - never come down Pass it around if you can't handle it Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates What's the difference between me and you? (What?) About five back accounts, three ounces and two vehicles Until my death, I'm Bangladesh I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left Yo that's the difference  Aight, hold up hold up! STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE!! I got somethin to say Dre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me (The fuck?!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit  [Dre] Riiight? .. Slim, I don't know if you noticed it But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch [Em] I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it? [Dre] Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is  Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma I'ma sit her up in the front seat and  put sunglasses on her And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California And have her wavin at people (Hi!)  Then drop her off on the corner at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off Drop the sawed off and beat you  wit the piece it was sawed off of Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up and they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product That's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up! You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!! So what's the difference between us?  We can start at the penis Or we can scream, \"I Just Don't Give a Fuck,\" and see who means it!"

Porque te amo Encima de todo esto Que te ha partido el alma y me hace maldecirle Hay algo que está claro y quiero que el mundo confirme Que yo te amo Más allá del sol Y más allá de todos mis errores Que no les quede duda que tú eres El más grande de todos mis amores Encima de todo esto Que a ti te siembra duda y me causa pena Me atrevo a asegurarte que el castillo no es de arena Yo sí te amo Encima de todo esto Emerge una verdad que me libera y es la neta Ya que estás empacando, llévatela en la maleta, la verdad Es que te amo Más allá del sol Y más allá de todos mis errores Que no te quede duda que tú eres El más grande de todos mis amores Más allá del sol Y más allá de todos mis errores Que no te quede duda que tú eres El más grande de todos mis amores El más grande... El más grande de todos mis amores"

Y yo no sé ni qué hacer, no tengo salida del lío Trato de besarte, pero el cuarto sigue frío Ella me grita, le grito y empieza el desafío (yo confío en que vuelvas a ser mi princesa) Dime qué te pasó (ajá) Tú no eres así Si tu amor se apagó Dímelo de frente, estoy aquí Y si el problema soy yo (ajá) Y no siente nada por mí Dímelo y yo me marcho, uoh-oh Que Dios se apiade de mí (yo lo que necesito es que tú me mires a la cara) Háblame (hey) Dale, dímelo de frente Ya todos lo saben, conmigo eres diferente ¿Por qué me mientes?, fui contigo decente Acusándome en el problema y yo soy inocente He intentado cambiar Mi forma de ser Pero tú te empeñas en retroceder ¿Qué vamos a hacer? Tienes que entender (y aunque me duela el corazón, mi posición es muy firme) Yo sé quién tú eres Yo fui tu hombre, tú mi mujer Yo sé que tú me quieres (tú sabes) Si yo te lo di todo Tú me hieres, eh-eh, oh-oh Y mi corazón se muere (tú no sabes lo que se siente) Sabes que (oh-oh) Nunca permitas que esta relación se convierta en una monotonía (oh-oh) No es necesario decir que por ti respiro, que Eres la mujer de mis sueños (eh-eh, oh-oh) Bueno (y mi corazón se muere) Solo resta por preguntar ¿Qué te pasa? Dime qué te pasó (ajá) Tú no eres así (yo sé que no) Si tu amor se apagó Dímelo de frente, estoy aquí (estoy aquí) Y si el problema soy yo Y no siente nada por mí Dímelo y yo me marcho, uoh-oh Que Dios se apiade de mí (usa la razón) Dime qué te pasó (hey) Tú no eres así Si tu amor se apagó Dímelo de frente, estoy aquí (tú sabes que te amo) Y si el problema soy yo Y no siente nada por mí Dímelo y yo me marcho, uoh-oh Que Dios se apiade de mí Muy simple W, Yandel Victor \"El Nazi\" Nesty El Profesor Gómez"

Look in my eye  Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort Suffocation, no breathing Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding  No, I don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding This is my last resort  Cut my life in a million pieces Walk through fire 'cause I've got no reason yet Don't kill me now 'cause I'm bleeding Drank Juggernog, now I'm healing Back and forth, I wage a war inside, I Toss and turn at night, it hurts, and then I Break through, had to find myself Took a last resort to fix this hell   ' Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine Losin' my sight (Sight), losin' my mind (Mind) Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine (I'm fine)  Nothing's alright (Right), nothing is fine (Fine) I'm runnin' and I'm crying  Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort Suffocation, no breathing Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding  Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort Suffocation, no breathing Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding (Losin' my sight, losin' my mind) Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort (Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine) Suffocation, no breathing (Losin' my sight, losin' my mind) Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding (Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine)  Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort"

I heard you moved to Austin  Got an apartment and settled down  And every once in a while  I start texting  Write a paragraph  But then I delete the message  Think about you like a past time  I could cry you a river  Get you baptised or  I wasn't ready to act right  Used to always think I'd get you back, right  They say that things fall apart  We were gonna move to Brooklyn  You were gonna study Art  Love is just a tool  To remind us who we are  And that we are not alone  And we're walking in the dark    I hope someday  We'll sit down together  And laugh with each other  About these days, these days  All our troubles  We'll lay to rest  And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days  We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days"

It's the rudimental things that make the world turn Forget whatever you know Follow what you have been told I will love you better, so that you don't forget Gone with the world in your hands A child's the father, a man I can't explain it all, but something came in the night And it washed my soul and made me whole And now everything's alright Shining and losing a light and grow If we never try, then we'll never know the basics Don't let it pass you by So, tell me when it all goes down?Are you gonna be around?I know you're gonna make it in But are you gonna make it out?So tell me will you stop and stare?Or are you gonna stand and speak?Yeah, when it comes to history Who you gonna be?Who you gonna be?Who you gonna be?Who you gonna be?Yeah  Growing up I never thought I'd be a role model To me it's crazy I relate to what I jot down Half my neighbourhood survived returning coke bottles The other half is middle class that played the class clown So often with no options, worked from so worthless to show stopping and globe trotting Both my parents had to die living the dream So who am I to tell you don't believe?No matter if it's winter, spring, summer, fall Tell 'em that we want it all Always going down the round When there ain't no one to call Can I trade my chocolate tie?In for a wonder ball Momma, I just wanna ball Momma, I just wanna ball And I don't ain't need someone to love me like you do Promise I'mma make it up to you Not a fan of letting go Gotta fight and have you know I'm here for you So, tell me when all goes down?Are you gonna be around?I know you're gonna make it in But are you gonna make it out?So tell me will you stop and stare?Or are you gonna stand and speak?Yeah, when it comes to history Who you gonna be?Who you gonna be?Who you gonna be?Who you gonna be?"

Yes sir    On the day old Curtis died, nobody came to pray  Ol' preacher said some words, and they chunked him in the clay  But he lived a lifetime playin' the black man's blues  And on the day he lost his life, that's all he had to lose    Play me a song Curtis Loew, Hey Curtis Loew  I wish that you was here so everyone would know  People said he was useless, them people all are fools   ' Cause Curtis you're the finest picker to ever play the blues"

It's like the game ain't the same Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us.45's and gauges, MAC's in fact Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin ' It drops deep as it does in my breath I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind  New York state of mind New York state of mind New York state of mind New York state of mind Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin ' Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin ' Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain And be prosperous, though we live dangerous Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages It's only right that I was born to use mics And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule The smooth criminal on beat breaks Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya Inhale deep like the words of my breath I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind  New York state of mind New York state of mind New York state of mind New York state of mind \"Nasty Nas—\""

Durante todo el tiempo que yo te busque\"  Ella le contesto \"Lo siento, es que estuve ocupada\"  Aunque para serte sincera, ahora no entiendo en que    La noche se hizo día, pero no se fue la luna  Se quedo a verlos apoyada en el hombro del sol  Alumbrales con fuerza, brilla todo el día  Y cuando llegue la noche, yo sellare su pasión    Dos extraños bailando bajo la luna  Se convierten en amantes al compás  De esa extraña melodía, que algunos llaman destino  Y otros prefieren llamar, casualidad    Y bailan sin que les importe nada, que suceda alrededor  Y bailan y la gente que les miran va creyendo en el amor    Dos extraños bailando bajo la luna  Se convierten en amantes al compás  De esa extraña melodía, que algunos llaman destino  Y otros prefieren llamar, casualidad"

Con la realidad te vas a dar de bruces  Si piensas que un euro es mejor que un detalle,  Porque una ventana que da a un patio luces  Puede brillar más que una que da a la calle.    Y ahora vete en busca de aquella cartera  Que sostenga tus tratamientos de belleza, mientras tengas,  Porque sabrás que eso no dura eternamente, amiga mía.    Así que vete en busca de cada delirio de grandeza  Y si la vida te endereza y tu caballo ganador se te despeña  Recuerda que tú rechazaste ser la flor para mi vida,  Por ser sólo un pétalo en la de ese tipo.    Que pena me das niñita consentida,  Con tu cheque falso al portamor vencido...    Aunque pensándolo bien:  ¿Cuál sería nuestro futuro?  Tú que prefieres un peso que un beso  Y yo no tengo ni un puto duro.  Tú que sólo comes hojas  Y yo sólo carne roja.  Yo vivo en un cuento chino  Y tú en una peli de Almodóvar.  Tú que presumes de atea  Mientras yo vivo de la marea  Que un dios puso en mi garganta.    Y ahora vete en busca de aquella cartera  Que sostenga tus tratamientos de belleza, mientras tengas,  Porque sabrás que eso no dura eternamente, amiga mía.    Así que vete en busca de cada delirio de grandeza  Y si la vida te endereza y tu caballo ganador se te despeña  Recuerda que tú rechazaste ser la flor para mi vida,  Por ser sólo un pétalo en la de ese tipo.    Que pena me das niñita consentida,  Con tu cheque falso al portamor vencido...    Yo sólo espero que esto no señale el broche  Pero cuando no te quede techo que alcanzar  Te sentirás vacía y como un jarro de agua fría será  Cuando mires atrás."

Stand in a line for a hole in the wall‘Cause people still need cash to buy their freedom Moving forward walking back Everyone is falling but we don't see them A day away from a stroke of bad luck Money's slipping right through the cracks It's a shame how we don't know What we really have  Tear it down 'til it's gone All you ever, all you ever wanted Kill the lights while they're on Is it all you ever, all you ever wanted? Is it all you ever wanted?Mine's the city with a thousand heartbeats But we're just trying to keep a dream alive New sign on an old street I don't recognise Tear it down 'til it's gone All you ever, all you ever wanted Kill the lights while they're on Is it all you ever, all you ever wanted?Is it all you ever wanted?"

I wanna talk about us without talking to an enemy  I've been broken down like my food in my stomach  Hatin' these feelings, but act like I love it  I don't wanna cheat, nah, I want fair play  I don't wanna crash land like an airplane  I want you back but when you act like that  Like a one-sided talk, you don't call me back  Yeah, times were hard and when you left, they got harder  My bed got colder and my room got darker  I'm still in love, I know, so are you  Why'd I pray for the rain when our skies were blue  I'm still in love, I know, so are you  Let's talk tonight and we can talk it through  I see, dead eyes on the verge of suicide  I realize it's not alright  I'll find my way to idolize it  In my eyes, I'll reach the sky  Tell me if I'm lost, and all the days it took  I gave it all I had, without a second look  And I need breathing room, if I don't see you soon  I think I'll die inside, I'll blame it all on you  I think I'm gone for good, it happened faster than it should  And now it's upside down, I must've misunderstood  But I still wish you were here, and maybe one day you will  And while I wait for you, I'll pop another pill  Black long sleeve, I can see you're freezing  You know I'll stop your bleeding  Let's not make this hard, let's just hit restart  Messed up badly, how'd this all happen  This world's a mess so please don't leave us stranded  I'm swimming in the ocean of fear  Back where I started, no closer each year  I think, maybe you'll start to disappear  As I cope with these emotions, I don't wanna get closer  I see, dead eyes on the verge of suicide  I realize it's not alright  I'll find my way to idolize it  In my eyes, I'll reach the sky  Dead eyes on the verge of suicide  I realize it's not alright  I'll find my way to idolize it  In my eyes, I'll reach the sky"

Can I hear?How does it feel?It's all such a mystery  But one kiss and I'll know If it's really meant to be, I won't let go They say true love is made in heaven One look and I'll see No other face for all eternity They say true love is made in heaven One kiss, true love One kiss, true love When it calls me, is it just like music and lights Or is that just a fairy tale?Will I see it?

En la academia militar enseñan medicina  Y los banqueros ahora dan viviendas y comida  Ya nadie sabe ser feliz a costa del despojo  Gracias a ti y a tus ojos."

(Hey, how I ain't see that?)  Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuck in the cul-de-sac  I pull up, get out, what up? I wanna help  But what you want for some, some niggas  Really don't want for themself  Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma  And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (Skrt)  So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awkward  And I heard through some words that you're off it  I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path  And crash and get distracted  But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain  Keep my windshield wipers prepared   ' Cause y'all throw so much shade (So much)  And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front  I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump  Just let me know, my nigga    I had to switch gears on 'em  Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrt!)  I had to switch gears on 'em  You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em  Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole  Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole  Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole  Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole    Snakes in the grass, but I walk  I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF  So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk  I left the condom in the grass so fuck off  Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it  Young successful nigga, ride Mc Laren with no windows tinted  I drive by piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'  The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon  Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely  All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies  But all I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things  That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please  Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf  Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool  Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool  Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself  Than fuck with their fleece  See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw  Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?  One day, \"Fuck no,\" the next day, \"Okay\"  But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four  I just want that garden and that Batmobile  Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile  Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards  But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles  Now keep it pushin', nigga    I had to switch gears on 'em  Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em (Skrrrrrt!)  I had to switch gears on 'em  You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em  Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole  Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole  Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole  Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole    Fuck, okay, next one  Do-do-do-do-do-do  Gotta watch out for the potholes  Ooh, said watch out for the potholes  Haha"

E só foi motivação, hoje eu sei que o som virou  E quem diria logo nóis de rueira, Red e Vulcano  Com cheiro de prosperidade, andando de nave do ano?  Joga esses cabelo e vem  Chega mais perto do meu colo, neném  Joga esses cabelo e vem  Se quiser ir pra onde eu vou, tudo acaba bem  Ah, aqui não é Hollywood, mas a cena nóis roubou  Bate as taça, faz um brinde a quem é merecedor  Pela paz nessa quebrada, mais saúde, mais amor  Quando achar que terminou, a festa apenas começou  Eu e meu desprazer  É o que me faz sentir prazer  É o que me faz enlouquecer  É o que me faz querer viver  E ver que tudo é passageiro  Solta esse cabelo e vem  Que hoje eu vim pra esbagaçar nessa porra  E nóis tá solteiro  Deixa o som bater, neném  Até a polícia chegar  Se pedir pra abaixar, nóis vai pra outro lugar  Oh, oh, oh-oh  Hoje eu quero ver esses cara preta queimar  Esses cara preta queimar  E como é bom viver, a vida passa e cê nem vê  E pra que sofrer? Mais tarde vamo ali no rolê  Logo mais o dia vai amanhecer outra vez  E é nóis de novo, dez horas da manhã do chinês  Não deixe ninguém roubar sua brisa  Esse é teu momento  Melhor tá isento desse mundinho violento  Certo é certo, é você mesmo  É quem faz o teu julgamento  Tudo passa, faz outro game, fi'  Dê tempo ao tempo  Hoje ninguém dorme  Tô na rua, daquele jeito  De rasante, na nave  Com os grave tremendo o peito  Bagaceiro, meio bandoleiro  Eu e um parceiro, contribuindo  Pra essa cidade virar um puteiro  Ontem, pensei: Pensar sozin', cê morre  E se pagar, vai ver porque que o DF não dorme  Coloca na balança o que pra ti tem mais valor  Amar é bom, mas melhor ainda é fazer amor  Eu e meu desprazer  É o que me faz sentir prazer  É o que me faz enlouquecer  É o que me faz querer viver  E ver que tudo é passageiro  Solta esse cabelo e vem  Que hoje eu vim pra esbagaçar nessa porra  E nóis tá solteiro  Deixa o som bater, neném  Até a polícia chegar  Se pedir pra abaixar, nóis vai pra outro lugar  Oh, oh, oh-oh  Hoje eu quero ver esses cara preta queimar  Esses cara preta queimar"

Um dois três, não te esqueci  Meu coração falta uma peça (quero outra vez)  Por falar em peça, você sempre atuou bem  (Só mais uma vez)  Meu coração falta uma peça  Nessa sua peça, eu fiz papel de refém  Essa dona é bagaceira  Coração puro, mas a mente é maloqueira  Disposição é o que não falta a noite inteira  Por fora é meiga, mas por dentro é traiçoeira, uoh oh  Ela me envolve  Esse olhar dela mata mais que mil revólver  Tá querendo guerra, eu tô procurando um love  E se ligo pra ela, ela sempre tá no corre, uoh oh  Ela me envolve  Esse olhar dela mata mais que mil revólver  Tá querendo guerra, eu tô procurando um love  E se ligo pra ela, ela sempre tá no corre, uoh oh  Aqui não, aqui não  Aqui não, aqui não  Aqui não, aqui não  Hungria Hip Hop, Lucas Lucco, aqui não"

Merry Christmas!But I think I'll miss this one this year Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!But I think I'll miss this one this year Emma:Tesco has provided me With the world's smallest turkey Already in the oven, nice and hot Oh damn, guess what I forgot?So it's on with the boots, back out in the snow To the only all-night garage But when to my wondering eyes should appear In the line that guy I've been chasing all year\"Spending this one alone,\" he said\"Need a break; this year's been crazy.\"I said, \"Me too, but why are you?You mean you forgot the papers too?\"Then suddenly we laughed and laughed Caught on to what was happening Christmas magic's brought this tale To a very happy ending All:Merry Christmas!

If they take me back to Texas,  They won't take me back alive.\"    There were seven Spanish angels at the altar of the sun.  They were prayin' for the lovers in the valley of the gun.    When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,  There was thunder from the throne,  And seven Spanish angels took another angel home.    She reached down and picked the gun up  That lay smoking in his hand.  She said, \"Father, please forgive me;  I can't make it without my man.\"    And she knew the gun was empty,  And she knew she couldn't win,  But her final prayer was answered  When the rifles fired again.    There were seven Spanish angels at the altar of the sun.  They were prayin' for the lovers in the valley of the gun.    When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,  There was thunder from the throne,  And seven Spanish angels took another angel home."

I fly a starship Across the Universe divide And when I reach the other side I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can Perhaps I may become a highwayman again Or I may simply be a single drop of rain But I will remain And I'll be back again And again, and again, and again And again, and again..."

Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop  In the place rainbow born and dies  And where the end of this life lies  I've always been insisting there was something that I've longing for    One day we'll reach to emotions unexplored unprecedented  We'll high-five love we've yet to discover and give a kiss to time  The five dimensions keep on teasing me  But I will keep on looking at you, dear  Let's make a sign for when we say \"nice to meet you\" again  I'm on my way to you, chasing after your name"

I'll stand by you at the intersection points of our existences  Blurring the edges of twilight  Enamored in entirely in disbelief  That back then you were the one who came for me  So I will treasure this experience because soon these memories will all seem to fade away from us    We’ll write our names upon these hands in this uncertainty  Tears keep on falling down  And I can remember  Divulging to your heart  Fading into light  Forever searching  Possessed by longing ever since the day the stars came falling  Nothing short of a beautiful view  Meet me someday beyond goodbye  Until that day I'll always be seeking out your name"

Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best   ' Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake  And eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state    And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus!

A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?  But he don't know the meanin' of dope  When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap  That's cleaner than a bar of soap  And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight  Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight    You best protect ya neck  You best protect ya neck  You best protect ya neck  You best protect ya neck"
